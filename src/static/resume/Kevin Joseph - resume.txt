Senior Web Developer
Renovate America, San Diego CA
May 2015 - April 2017

My first team at RA was focused on an internal-facing toolkit for the call center. Much of the work focused on transferring functions from an outdated native Java desktop app to the web app. Most of the front-end work was in AngularJS (1.x) and Microsoft .NET Razor. Occasionally, I needed to modify the C#-based API.

One major project was creating an interface for adding products to a customer's project, moving it from a jQuery-heavy independent page to an integrated part of the larger toolkit. The leaders of the call center were happy with the new interface, noting that it would make their duties much easier.

The second team maintained the customer-facing marketing website. This site was built on SiteCore for content management, and also included AngularJS and Razor in the front-end stack.

Main technologies: AngularJS (1.x), Bootstrap, CSS / Sass, Git, Gulp, HTML 5, JavaScript, Kendo UI, Microsoft .NET Razor, Microsoft C#, Microsoft TFS

Web Developer
Best Buy, Richfield MN (contract)
September 2013 - March 2015

I was part of a small development group working on the analytics for the main BestBuy.com website. Working with the UI/UX developers, we would take in information from the site and package it to send to Adobe Analytics for tracking.

At one point we completely overhauled our codebase, moving from two large, mostly duplicated, jQuery-infused files to a module-based framework using RequireJS and integrated the new framework with Signal Tag Manager.

Main technologies: Adobe Analytics, Git, HTML, JavaScript, Jenkins, jQuery, Lodash, RequireJS, Signal Tag Manager

While the lead front-end developer for the Cox Media sites, I was responsible for (among other projects) the implementation of Adobe Analytics tracking code across their sites as well as adding a new ad unit framework.
